### History of JavaScript

\ - `Netscape Navigator` is a web browser
- It decided to have a programming language to add interactivity to its web pages
- Brendan Eich created a language and  named it `MOCHA`
- After that `MOCHA` was renamed to `Livescript`
- At that point when `Livescript was introduced`, `JAVA` was in popular
- `Livescript` was renamed to `JavaScript`
- At that point, `Internet Explorer` (web browser) copied Javascript and created it's own language `JScript`
- Because of 2 different languages, websites sometimes, would not open on another browser. So to Standardise, Javascript was taken to ECMA.
- ECMA created `ECMAScript`, which had standards, which a new web scripting language should follow to be implemented in a browser.

\ `ES5` : ES2009 (Lots of new features in javascript)
\ `ES6` : ES2015 (Biggest Update / Modern Javascript)
\ `ES7` : ES2016

### JAVASCRIPT is Backward Compatible
It means that, Old features will still work in new versions of JS. 
\ `But not Forward Compatible` : Means, A feature launched today, will not work in a old browser that has not been updated since ages.
